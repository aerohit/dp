Sample code from the HeadFirst series.

Design Principles:

Chapter 1 - The strategy pattern
* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A).
