## Design Principles:

Sample code from the HeadFirst series.

### Chapter 1 - The strategy pattern

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A).

### Chapter 2- The observer pattern

* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

### Chapter 3- The decorator pattern
